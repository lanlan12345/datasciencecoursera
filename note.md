===================
[https://stackedit.io/editor] here is link to understand markdown, quite useful to make my notes here.
[http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/06/git_remote.html] helpful explanation
```
cd desktop
```
to make you work directory, from which Git can push your file

then,
```
git init

git add HelloWorld.md

git commit -m "add Helloworld.md"
```
Until now we just submitted locally
```
git add origin https://github.com/lanlan12345/datasciencecoursera.git

git push origin master 
```
