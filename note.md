]helpful explanation
```
cd desktop
```
to make you work directory, from which Git can push your file.

we can find help by (eg. add) 
```
git help add
```
we can quit the help page by typing `q` 

then,
```
git init

git add HelloWorld.md

git commit -m "add Helloworld.md"
```
Until now we just submitted locally
```
git add origin https://github.com/lanlan12345/datasciencecoursera.git

git push origin master 
```
